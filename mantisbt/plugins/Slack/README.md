MantisBT-Slack
==============

A [MantisBT](http://www.mantisbt.org/) plugin to send bug updates to [Slack](https://slack.com/) and [Mattermost](https://about.mattermost.com/) channels.


# Setup
* The `master` branch requires Mantis 2.0.x, while the `master-1.2.x` branch works for Mantis 1.2.x.
* Extract this repo to your *Mantis folder/plugins/Slack*.
* On the Slack side, add a new "Incoming Webhooks" integration and note the URL that Slack generates for you.
* On the MantisBT side, access the plugin's configuration page and fill in your Slack webhook URL.
* You can map your MantisBT projects to Slack channels by setting the *plugin_Slack_channels* option in Mantis.  Follow the instructions on the plugin's configuration page to get there. Make sure the *plugin_Slack_channels* configuration option is set to "All Users", with type "complex".
    Example value for this setting:

            array (
              'My First Mantis Project' => '#general',
              'My Second Mantis Project' => '#second-project'
            )

* You can specify which bug fields appear in the Slack notifications. Edit the *plugin_Slack_columns* configuration option for this purpose.  Follow the instructions on the plugin configuration page.
